# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A **Tic Tac Toe game** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking "X" or "O". HTML structures the grid, CSS styles it for visual appeal, and JavaScript manages game logic, including turn tracking, win/draw checks, and game resets. It's a simple yet interactive project for beginner web developers.
